# Strider Extension Loader

[![Build Status](https://hosted.stridercd.com/51f050cf04568a0c00000008/strider-cd/strider-extension-loader/badge)](https://hosted.stridercd.com/Strider-CD/strider-extension-loader/)

[Strider](https://github.com/Strider-CD/strider) is an extensible CI
system, written in node. Strider extensions are simply NPM packages
with additional metadata contained in a file named
`strider.json`. This metadata tells Strider which JavaScript source
files should be loaded and initialized.

Hence, to install a new Strider extension, you can just `npm install`
it in your strider repositiory.

This is a small Node.JS library for loading Strider extensions.

## API

### collectExtensions(dirs, done(err))

Collect all strider extensions found in the given directories.

### initWebAppExtensions(context, done(err, extensions))

Load the "webapp" portion of all extensions.

`extensions` looks like `{plugintype: {pluginid: loadedPlugin, ... }, ...}`

### initWorkerExtensions(context, done(err, extensions))

Same as `initWebAppExtensions` but for the `worker` portion.

### initTemplates(done(err, templates))

Load all of the templates from all extensions. `templates` looks like
`{templatename: stringtemplate, ...}`.

### initStaticDirs(app, done(err))

Register the `/static/` directories of all plugins to map to `/ext/:pluginid`.

## Strider Extensions

### Extension types

- runner: runs the jobs, like strider-docker-runner
- provider: gets the source code for a project, like strider-github or strider-hg
- job: effects the way a job runs, runs tests, sets up the environment, like strider-node or strider-sauce
- basic: does whatever you want

### Webapp vs Worker

There are two environments where plugins are loaded, webapp and worker.

#### Webapp environment

Effects the way the strider webapp works, how it looks, etc. You can
define templates, serve static files, listen to global strider events,
and other great things.

#### Worker environment

This code is loaded for each job that is run, by the process that is
running the job. This may be the same process as the webapp (as when
using `strider-simple-runner`), or it might be somewhere else
entirely. Accordingly, it is recommended that you not depend on
network connections unless absolutely necessary. In many cases, you
can pass a message up to the strider app and handle it in your
`webapp` code.

### Strider.json

To declare your npm package as a strider plugin, include a
`strider.json` in the base directory. Alternatively, you can have a
`strider` section to your `package.json`.

`strider.json` schema:

```javascript
{
  "id": "pluginid", // must be unique.
  "title": "Human Readable",
  "type": "runner | provider | job | basic", // defaults to basic
  "webapp": "filename.js", // loaded in the webapp environment
  "worker": "filename.js", // loaded in the worker environment
  "templates": {
    "tplname": "<div>Hello {{ name }}</div>",
    "tplname": "path/to/tpl.html"
  },
  // other configurations
}
```

Additionally, if there is a `/static/` directory, the files within it
will be accessible at the path `/ext/:pluginid`.

### Runner

Runner plugins do not get loaded in the worker environment.

#### Webapp

```javascript
module.exports = {
  config: {}, // mongoose schema. This will be per-project config
  appConfig: {}, // mongoose schema. Global config
  create: function (emitter, options, callback(err, runner)) {  }
}
```

#### Runner object

##### properties

These are used for the strider admin dashboard.

- `capacity`
- `running` number of jobs currently running
- `queued` length of the queue

##### handles events

- `job.new (job)` see strider-runner-core for a description of the `job` data
- `job.cancel (jobid)` if the runner has the specified job, either
  queued or in process, stop it and fire the `job.canceled` event

Runners are only expected to handle a job if `job.project.runner.id`
identifies it as belonging to this runner.

##### emits events

- `browser.update (eventname, data)` this is for proxying internal
  `job.status` events up to the browser
- `job.queued (jobid, time)`
- `job.done (data)`

#### Extra config

- `panel` see the job plugin section
- `appPanel` similar to panel, but for global config

### Provider

Provider plugins that need an ssh keypair are encouraged to use the
`privkey` and `pubkey` that are defined for each project. They are
attributes on the `project` object.

#### Webapp

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // mongoose schema for project-specific config
  config: {
    /* `url: String` and `display_url: String` are automatically defined. */
  },
  // mongoose schema for user-level config (like a github OAuth token) and/or cache
  userConfig: {},
  // optional; used by services such as github, bitbucket, etc.
  listRepos: function (userConfig, done(err, repos)) {},
  // namespaced to /ext/:pluginid
  routes: function (app, context) {
  }
}
```

The `repos` that are returned by `listRepos` are a list of objects
which, when activated, will be the provider config for the project. As
such, it is required to have a `url` that is unique, and it should
also define a `display_url` where appropriate. All other config is up
to you.

```javascript
{
   // this has to be unique; it's how we identify whether a project
   // has already been configured.
   url: 'http://example.com/unique/url.git',
   // optional - linked to from the project page
   display_url: 'http://example.com/path/to/repo',
   // everything else is up to you.
}
```

##### Worker

If just a function is exposed, it is assumed to be "fetch".

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // get the source code for a project. This is where the real work gets done.
  //   dest: the path to put things
  //   context: contains runCmd, io (for event passing)
  fetch: function (dest, userConfig, config, job, context, done) {
  },
}
```

##### Extra Config

Use `panel` for project-level config, and `userPanel` for user-level config.

- `inline_icon` you can also define a `24x24` icon for the
  `display_url` links. If this is not a path, it is assumed to be the
  name of an icon from `FontAwesome` (without the `icon-` prefix) and
  will be loaded as such. Defaults to `external-link`.

### Job

#### Webapp

```javascript
{
   config: {}, // mongoose schema, if you need project-specific config
   // Define project-specific routes
   //   all routes created here are namespaced within /:org/:repo/api/:pluginid
   //   req.project is the current project
   //   req.accessLevel is the current user's access level for the project
   //      0 - anonymous, 1 - authed, 2 - admin / collaborator
   //   req.user is the current user
   //   req.pluginConfig() -> get the config for this plugin
   //   req.pluginConfig(config, cb(err)) -> set the config for this plugin
   routes: function (app, context) {
   },
   // Define global routes
   //   all routes namespaced within /api/:pluginid
   //   req.user is the current user
   globalRoutes: function (app, context) {
   },
   // Listen for global events
   //   all job-local events that begin with `plugin.` are proxied to
   //   the main strider eventemitter, so you can listen for them here.
   //   Other events include `job.new`, `job.done` and `browser.update`.
   listen: function (emitter, context) {
   }
}
```

#### Worker

If only a function is exposed, it is assumed to be the `init(config,
job, cb)` function.

Autodetection rules are only used when a project has no plugins
configured.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Initialize the plugin for a job
  //   config: the config for this job, made by extending the DB config
  //           with any flat-file config
  //   job:    see strider-runner-core for a description of that object
  //   cb(err, initializedPlugin)
  init: function (config, job, cb) {
    return cb(null, {
      // string or list - to be added to the PATH
      path: path.join(__dirname, 'bin'),
      // any extra env variables. Will be available during all phases
      env: {},
      // Listen for events on the internal job emitter.
      //   Look at strider-runner-core for an
      //   enumeration of the events. Emit plugin.[pluginid].myevent to
      //   communicate things up to the browser or to the webapp.
      listen: function (emitter) {
      },
      // For each phase that you want to deal with, provide either a
      // shell command [string] for a fn(context, done(err, didrun))
      env: 'nvm install ' + (config.version || '0.10'),
      prepare: 'npm install',
      test: function (context, done) {
        checkSomething(context, function (shouldDoThings) {
          if (!shouldDoThings) {
            // Send `false` to indicate that we didn't actually run
            // anything. This is so we can warn users when no plugins
            // actually do anything during a test run, and avoid false
            // positives.
            return done(null, false);
          }
          doThings(function (err) {
            done(err, true);
          });
        });
      },
      cleanup: 'rm -rf node_modules'
    });
  }
  // this is only used if there is _no_ plugin configuration for a
  // project. See gumshoe for documentation on detection rules.
  autodetect: {
    filename: 'package.json',
    exists: true
  }
}
```

##### Phase Context

- job
- project
- dataDir
- phase

###### `cmd(cmd || options, done(exitCode))` Run a shell command

```
{
  cmd: "shell string" || {command: "", args: [], screen: ""},
  env: {}, // any extra env variables
  cwd: "" // defaults to the root directory of the project
}
```

If the command contains sensitive information (such as a password or
OAuth token), you can specify a `screen` command, which is what will
be output.

###### status(type, args) Update the job status

See `strider-runner-core` for the `job.status.` events. This emits a
`job.status.[type]` event with [jobid] + arguments.

###### out(data, type) Output

Type defaults to `stdout`. It can be one of `stderr`, `message`,
`error`, `warn`. `error` and `warn` are prefixed by a colored
`[STRIDER] WARN | ERROR` and sent to `stderr`. `message` is prefixed
by a colored `[STRIDER]` and sent to `stdout`.

###### Other context data

You shouldn't need to use these, but they're there.

- logger
- io

#### Extra config

##### Icon

Job plugins can also define an `icon` in the `strider.json` object,
which is the path to a 48x48 image that will be shown on the project
configuration page when a user is enabling plugins.

##### Config Panel

If the plugin requires special configuration, it can also define a
`panel` object in `strider.json`, which looks like:

```javascript
"panel": {
  "src": "path/to/file.html",
  "controller": "NameOfCtrl" // defaults to [pluginid]Controller
}
```

Define the angular controller in `/static/project_config.js`, which
will be loaded.

See [strider-webhooks](https://github.com/Strider-CD/strider-webhooks)
for an example of a custom config panel.

### Basic

This is where you do whatever you want. It will not be listed in the
UI anywhere automatically, so user configuration will require your own
ingenuity. If the need arises, we might expose some kind of config on
the system level to strider administrators, but not at the moment.

#### Worker

You can listen for events, but you shouldn't run any tests or interact
with the source code in any way. For that, write a `job` plugin.

```javascript
module.exports = function (context, job, done) {
}
```

#### Webapp

```javascript
module.exports = function (context, done) {
}
```


### Webapp Plugin Context

This is what gets passed into the `basic` init function, as well as
the `listen` and `routes` functions of various plugin types.

- config ; main strider config
- emitter ; for passing events
- models
- logger
- middleware
- auth
- app ; the express app
- registerBlock

#### registerBlock(name, cb)

```javascript
ctx.registerBlock('HeaderBrand', function(context, cb){
  // context has a lot of useful stuff on it:

  var email = context.currentUser.user.email

  // You can do some async processing here, but bear in mind
  // you'll be blocking the page load.

  cb(null, "<h1>FooStrider</h1>");
})
```

#### Templates in strider.json

Because writing a bunch of `registerBlock` calls for simple pieces of template
overrides is a little tedious, you can also use the following shortcut in your
strider.json:

```javascript
{
  "templates": {
    "HeaderBrand" : "<h1>An HTML String</h1>",
    "FooterTOS" : "./path/to/TOS.html"
  }
}
```
These are either inline strings or paths to static HTML. There is no templating
available for these at present.

*Note* If more than one override is specified for a block, then the first one
will be used. At the moment this means that extensions can squash each other.
If you want to simply 'append' to a block, use the `registerBlock` method
and make sure that you prefix the html you return with:
`ctx.content` which will contain either the default html, or the content from
previous extensions.
